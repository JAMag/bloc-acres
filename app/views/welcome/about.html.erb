    <p id="about-text3" >At Bloc-Acres safety is paramount. Inviting someone you don't know into your home can be concerning. Although internet services abound that connect strangers to drive you from place to place or rent a spare bedroom under the same roof, Bloc-Acres understands the squemishness involved and so takes every opportunity to emphasize safety and security. As such, it has implemented triple verification of all members. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p id="about-text4" >For a buyer to view your house, she must be a member of the site. This requires a valid email address, credit card, smartphone and number. Should a seller wish further verification, you may require that a buyer be prequalified from a bank. Furthermore, web cameras take a picture of viewers entering and exiting the house during a showing. Sellers of property on Bloc-Acres are provided a safe, an electronic lock and insurance. When you sell your house you may either leave these at your old house, or take them with you to keep the conveniance and security they provide at your new home. Bloc-Acres has a zero tolerance policy for safety matters. Your home and family are safe with Bloc-Acres.</p>
