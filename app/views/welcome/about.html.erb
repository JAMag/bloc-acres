<p>Founded in January of 2015 as a capstone project for my Bloc Full Stack Web Development program, Bloc-acres is a community marketplace for people to list, discover, and purchase unique properties around the world â€” online or from a mobile phone or tablet.</p>

<p>Whether an apartment, a house, or a villa, Bloc-acres connects people to unique properties without a realtor. Bloc-acres is the easiest way for people to show and sell thier property without the standard costs of a realtor.</p>

    <p>At Bloc-Acres safety is paramount. Inviting someone you don't know into your home can be concerning. Although internet services abound with services that connect strangers to drive you from place to place or rent a spare bedroom under the same roof, Bloc-Acres understands the squemishness involved and so takes every opportunity to emphasize safety and security. As such, it has implemented triple verification of all members. </p>
    <br></br>
    <p>For a buyer to enter your house to view it, she must be a member of the site. This requires a valid email address, credit card and smartphone. Should a seller wish further verification, for a larger fee you may require that a buyer be prequalified from a bank. Furthermore, web cameras take a picture of viewers entering and exiting the house during a showing. Sellers of property on Bloc-Acres are provided a safe, an electronic lock and insurance. When you sell your house you may either leave these new at your old house, or take them with you to keep the conveniance of electronic locks and security cameras to your new home. Furthermore, members of the site can rate each other. Bloc-Acres has a zero tolerance policy for safety matters. Your home is safe with Bloc-Acres.</p>
