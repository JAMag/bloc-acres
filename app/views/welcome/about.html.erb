    <p id="about-text3" >Sellers may set their own schedule of showings. Buyers book appointments to view a house. They are provided with an electronic key that is functional for less than fifteen minutes. All changes to the lock are monitored. The electronic lock auto-secures after your buyer leaves. That electronic key is digitally destroyed, so buyers are unable to view the house again with re-registering through our site.</p>
    <br></br>
    <p id="about-text4" >For a buyer to view your house, she must be a member of the site. This requires a valid email address, credit card, smartphone and number. Should a seller wish further verification, you may require that a buyer be pre-qualified from a bank. Sellers of property on Bloc-Acres are provided, an electronic lock and insurance. When you sell your house you may either leave these at your old house, or take them with you for the convenience and security at your new home. Buyer's must put a hold on their card in the case of damage and pay a fee to visit your house. Bloc-Acres has a zero tolerance policy for safety matters. Your home is safe with Bloc-Acres.</p>
